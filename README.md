# ColorSpectrum: Unlocking the Power of Color Analysis
**" Revolutionizing color-based data analysis and visualization"**

ColorSpectrum is a Go-based library designed to simplify and accelerate the process of color analysis and visualization. This project aims to provide developers with a robust and efficient toolkit for extracting valuable insights from color data, empowering them to create innovative applications in various domains such as computer vision, graphics, and data science.

At its core, ColorSpectrum leverages advanced algorithms and data structures to analyze and process color information, enabling the extraction of meaningful features and patterns from color data. This library is particularly useful for applications that require color-based object recognition, image segmentation, or color palette generation.

One of the primary benefits of ColorSpectrum is its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing data pipelines and workflows, allowing developers to focus on building high-level applications without worrying about the intricacies of color analysis. Furthermore, ColorSpectrum's modular design ensures that it can be easily extended and customized to accommodate diverse use cases and requirements.

## Key Features

* **Color Space Conversion**: Supports conversions between various color spaces, including RGB, HEX, HSL, and Lab, ensuring compatibility with different data formats and applications.
* **Color Distance Calculation**: Implements advanced distance metrics, such as CIE94 and CMC, to accurately measure the similarity between colors.
* **Color Clustering**: Utilizes k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify and group similar colors in a dataset.
* **Color Palette Generation**: Automatically generates a palette of colors based on a input dataset, ideal for designing visually appealing visualizations.
* **Image Processing**: Provides functions for image filtering, resizing, and cropping, enabling efficient processing of color data.
* **Data Serialization**: Supports serialization of color data to popular formats, including JSON and CSV.

## Technology Stack

* **Go**: The primary programming language used for developing the ColorSpectrum library, taking advantage of its concurrency features and performance.
* **gonum.org/v1/plot**: A popular Go plotting library used for visualizing color data and generating informative plots.
* **github.com/disintegration/imaging**: A fast and efficient image processing library used for tasks such as image resizing and filtering.

## Installation

To install ColorSpectrum, follow these steps:

1. Install Go on your system if you haven't already.
